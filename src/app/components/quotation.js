                            My passion is travel, I just love visiting new places, immersing myself into local cultures of life around the world and discovering the unexpected! Stepping off a plane, I’m always in a hurry to get my passport stamped, reclaim my luggage and walk out of the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure.
                            I love the planning, the anticipation, the journey, be it by plane, train, bus or boat and of course, the actual holiday and finally all the wonderful memories and experiences I bring home that live with me forever. That was the original reason why I created this blog so that I could have an online diary of my recent trips to look back on in the future. I’ve been surprised but thrilled that so many of you have taken an interest in my travels and enjoy reading about my trips – it’s very encouraging and makes me very happy! From starting as a hobby my blog has evolved into an award winning online travel resource providing inspiration to fellow travellers.
